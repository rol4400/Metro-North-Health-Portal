# Metro North Health Portal
I developed a client management portal for the hospital that managed existing clients, onboarding, symptoms, appointments, etc. It also included a wiki of information pages that was designed to the Qld government design regulations, and was built off Node JS and React JS frameworks. I worked together with a team of 4 to develop the project. I focused mostly on the backend development. As the project was completed early, I also implemented two additional features: an editor and quiz module. The editor allowed any of the elements of the website to be edited in place real-time with WISIWIG-style editing, syncing the changes with the database. The quiz module was developed for quizzing clients about their symptoms and showing different recommendations in a user-friendly manner. These were both developed from scratch using the above JavaScript frameworks.

## User Guide
The code for this project is closed-source, however below is a user guide demonstrating the functionality I implemented. The front end design was done strictly according to the queensland government style guide.
